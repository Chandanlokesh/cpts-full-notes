### Scenario 1: Phishing Investigation

- **Incident:** A suspicious email pretending to be from the company's bank is flagged.
    
- **Initial Investigation:**
    
    - A WHOIS lookup is performed on the domain linked in the email.
        
    - Key findings from WHOIS:
        
        - Registration Date: Recently registered.
            
        - Registrant: Hidden behind a privacy service.
            
        - Name Servers: Associated with a known bulletproof hosting provider.
            
- **Analysis:**
    
    - Recent registration and hidden registrant information are red flags.
        
    - Bulletproof hosting is commonly used for malicious activities.
        
- **Action Taken:**
    
    - The security analyst alerts the IT department to block the domain.
        
    - Employees are warned about the phishing scam.
        
    - Further investigation into the hosting provider is initiated.
        

### Scenario 2: Malware Analysis

- **Incident:** A security researcher is analyzing a malware strain that communicates with a remote C2 server.
    
- **Initial Investigation:**
    
    - A WHOIS lookup is performed on the C2 domain.
        
    - Key findings from WHOIS:
        
        - Registrant: Uses a free email service known for anonymity.
            
        - Location: Registrant is in a country with high cybercrime.
            
        - Registrar: Known for lax abuse policies.
            
- **Analysis:**
    
    - The C2 domain is likely hosted on a compromised or bulletproof server.
        
- **Action Taken:**
    
    - The researcher notifies the hosting provider of malicious activity.
        

### Scenario 3: Threat Intelligence Report

- **Incident:** A cybersecurity firm tracks a sophisticated threat actor group.
    
- **Investigation:**
    
    - WHOIS data is collected for multiple domains used by the group.
        
    - Key insights from WHOIS analysis:
        
        - Registration Dates: Domains registered in clusters before attacks.
            
        - Registrants: Various aliases and fake identities used.
            
        - Name Servers: Often shared, indicating a common infrastructure.
            
        - Takedown History: Many domains were taken down after attacks.
            
- **Outcome:**
    
    - Analysts create a detailed profile of the threat actorâ€™s tactics.
        
    - Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are compiled for future detection.

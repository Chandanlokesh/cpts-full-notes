### Plugins
- Plugins are readily available software that has already been released by third parties and have given approval to the creators of Metasploit to integrate their software inside the framework.
- Plugins directly with the API and can be used to manipulate the entire framework. They can be useful for automating repetitive tasks, adding new commands to the `msfconsole`, and extending the already powerful framework.

### Using Plugins
- need to ensure it is installed in the correct directory on our machine.
- Navigating to `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins`

```shell-session
ls /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins
```

If the plugin is found here, we can fire it up inside `msfconsole`

```shell
msf > load nessus

msf > nessus_help

#if we get any error we can use this command

msf > load Plugin_That_Does_Not_Exist

```

### installing new plugins
- we can take the .rb file provided on the maker's page and place it in the folder at `/usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins` with the proper permissions.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/darkoperator/Metasploit-Plugins
ls Metasploit-Plugins
.....
.....

#we can copy all those plugins to the folder 


sudo cp ./Metasploit-Plugins/pentest.rb /usr/share/metasploit-framework/plugins/pentest.rb

```

check the plugin's installation by running the `load` command.
```shell-session
msf6 > load pentest
```

### Mixins
**Mixins** are **modules** (Ruby classes that can't be instantiated) that provide **methods** to other classes **without requiring inheritance**. Instead of creating a hierarchy of parent and child classes, Ruby allows you to "mix in" reusable code via the `include` keyword. This is why we say mixins are a form of **inclusion**, not inheritance.

- A module might include a **network protocol** mixin like `Tcp`, `Udp`, or `Http`.
    
- Exploits can include common payload handlers or session management features.

Using mixins means you can add extra functionality to payloads (or any other module), even if those features werenâ€™t originally part of the base class.

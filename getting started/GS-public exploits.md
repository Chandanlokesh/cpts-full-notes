A well-known tool for this purpose is `searchsploit`, which we can use to search for public vulnerabilities/exploits for any application.
we can install 
```bash
sudo apt install exploitdb -y
```

then we can search 
```bash
searchsploit openssh 7.2
```
We can also utilize online exploit databases to search for vulnerabilities, like [Exploit DB](https://www.exploit-db.com), [Rapid7 DB](https://www.rapid7.com/db/), or [Vulnerability Lab](https://www.vulnerability-lab.com).

The platform offers single challenges in categories such as reverse engineering, cryptography, steganography, pwn, web, forensics, OSINT, mobile, hardware, and more at various difficulty levels designed to test technical and critical thinking skills.

There are also single machines (boxes) of various operating system types, small (and challenging) mini-labs called Endgames, Fortresses that are single machines containing many challenges, and Pro Labs, which are large simulated enterprise networks where users can perform a mock penetration test at various difficulty levels.

#### Tutorial Websites
Two great tutorial websites are [Under The Wire](https://underthewire.tech/wargames) and [Over The Wire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/). These websites are set up to help train users on using both Windows `PowerShell` and the Linux command line, respectively, through various scenarios in a "war games" format.

- try to do pentest form a freshly installed os 
- make a script that can install all the tools that is needed 
- There are quite a few options available to us: [Hyper-V](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/) on Windows, as virtual machines on [bare metal hypervisors](https://www.vmware.com/topics/bare-metal-hypervisor) such as [Proxmox](https://proxmox.com/en/) or [VMware ESXi](https://www.vmware.com/products/esxi-and-esx.html) or using free hypervisors such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), or [VMware Workstation Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html), which can be installed and used as hypervisors on Windows and Linux operating systems.

#### ISO

The `ISO` file is essentially just a CD-ROM that can be mounted within our hypervisor of choice to build the VM by installing the operating system ourselves. An `ISO` gives us more room for customization, e.g., keyboard layout, locale, desktop environment switch, custom partitioning, etc.,

#### OVA

The `OVA` file is a pre-built virtual appliance that contains an `OVF` XML file that specifies the VM hardware settings and a `VMDK`, which is the virtual disk that the operating system is installed on. An `OVA` is pre-built and therefore can be rapidly deployed to get up and running quicker.

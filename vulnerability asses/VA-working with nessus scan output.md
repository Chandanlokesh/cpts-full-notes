Nessus gives us the option to export scan results in a variety of report formats as well as the option to export raw Nessus scan results to be imported into other tools, archived, or passed to tools, such as [EyeWitness](https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness), which can be used to take screenshots of all web applications identified by Nessus and greatly assist us with working through the results and finding more value in them.

The `.nessus` file is an `.xml` file and includes a copy of the scan settings and plugin outputs. The `.db` file contains the `.nessus` file and the scan's KB, plugin Audit Trail, and any scan attachments. More information about the `KB` and `Audit Trail` can be found [here](https://community.tenable.com/s/article/What-is-included-in-a-nessus-db-file).

Scripts such as the [nessus-report-downloader](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eelsivart/nessus-report-downloader/master/nessus6-report-downloader.rb) can be used to quickly download scan results in all available formats from the CLI using the Nessus REST API:
```shell-session
./nessus_downloader.rb 
```

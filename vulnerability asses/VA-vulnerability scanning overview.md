- Vulnerabilities scanners typically do not exploit vulnerabilities (with some exceptions) but need a human to manually validate scan issues
- A vulnerability scan can help gain additional coverage during a penetration test or speed up the project's testing under time constraints. An actual penetration test includes much more than just a scan.
- A `static test` would determine a vulnerability if the identified version of a particular asset has a public CVE
- On the other hand, a `dynamic test` tries specific (usually benign) payloads such as weak credentials, SQL injection, or command injection on the target (i.e., a web application). If any payload returns a hit, then there's a good chance that it is vulnerable.
- organise should have unauthenticated and authenticated scan

## Introduction

- A Vulnerability Assessment identifies and categorizes security weaknesses in assets within an environment.
    
- Minimal or no manual exploitation is involved.
    
- Provides remediation steps to fix identified issues.
    

## Purpose

- To understand, identify, and categorize risks for security weaknesses without exploiting them.
    
- Customers may request:
    
    - Validation of vulnerabilities with minimal exploitation (confirming scanner findings).
        
    - Reporting of all scanner-identified findings.
        
- Clarify assessment scope and intent before starting.
    

## Importance

- Helps organizations identify weak points in assets.
    
- Assists in understanding risk levels and prioritizing remediation efforts.
    
- Substantial patches should be tested before deployment to prevent disruptions.
    

## Methodology

## Key Terms

- **Vulnerability:** A weakness or bug in an environment that could be exploited.
    
    - Scored using CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System).
        
    - Example: SQL injection allowing unauthorized data access.
        
- **Threat:** A process that increases the potential for a security event (e.g., a hacker exploiting a vulnerability).
    
- **Exploit:** Code or resources used to take advantage of a vulnerability.
    
- **Risk:** The possibility of assets being harmed by threats.

## Asset Management

- Begin by creating an inventory of data assets.
    
- Types of assets include:
    
    - Information Technology (IT)
        
    - Operational Technology (OT)
        
    - Physical, Software, Mobile, and Development assets.
        
- Use asset management tools to track and manage assets.

## Asset Inventory

- Must include:
    
    - On-premises storage (HDDs, SSDs, external drives).
        
    - Cloud storage (AWS, GCP, Azure).
        
    - SaaS data (Google Drive, Dropbox, Office 365).
        
    - Applications (both local and cloud-based).
        
    - Network devices (routers, firewalls, IDS/IPS).
        

## Best Practices

- Regularly update asset inventory to account for changes.
    
- Prioritize assets based on sensitivity and criticality.
    
- Implement robust access controls for sensitive assets.

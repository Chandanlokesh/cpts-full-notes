## Scanning Issues

- Nessus is a widely used vulnerability scanning platform.
    
- Before starting a scan:
    
    - Communicate with clients or internal stakeholders.
        
    - Identify sensitive or legacy hosts to exclude.
        
    - Determine if high-priority hosts should be scanned outside business hours.
        
- Unexpected scan results may require fine-tuning.
    

## Mitigating Issues

- Common issues:
    
    - Firewalls may cause all ports to appear open or closed.
        
    - False positives can occur due to ICMP responses.
        
- Solutions:
    
    - Disable "Ping the remote host" option in Advanced Scan settings.
        
    - Use rate-limiting for sensitive networks (adjust Max Concurrent Checks).
        
    - Exclude legacy systems and avoid scanning printers.
        
    - Use the `nessusd.rules` file for fine-tuned scan control.
        
    - Avoid Denial of Service (DoS) checks unless explicitly requested.
        
    - Enable "Safe Checks" to minimize impact and avoid risky plugins.
        
- Always maintain clear communication with stakeholders.
    
- Keep detailed logs of all scanning activities.
    

## Network Impact

- Vulnerability scans can affect network performance, especially on low bandwidth or congested links.
    
- Monitor network traffic using `vnstat` before and during scans:
    
    - Install `vnstat`: `sudo apt install vnstat`
        
    - Monitor interface (e.g., eth0): `sudo vnstat -l -i eth0`
        
- Example statistics:
    
    - Before scan: Low traffic (few bytes and packets).
        
    - During scan: High traffic (increased bytes and packets).
        
- Compare results to assess the scan's network impact.

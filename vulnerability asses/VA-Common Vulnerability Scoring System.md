## Vulnerability Assessment

- Identifies and categorizes risks for security weaknesses in assets.
    
- No manual exploitation, only scanning and remediation steps.
    
- Clarify scope and intent before starting.
    

## Methodology

1. Asset Identification
    
2. Vulnerability Identification
    
3. Vulnerability Validation
    
4. Risk Assessment
    
5. Remediation Planning

## Understanding Key Terms

- **Vulnerability:** A weakness in an asset that can be exploited.
    
- **Threat:** An event or actor that can exploit a vulnerability.
    
- **Exploit:** Code or resources to exploit a vulnerability.
    
- **Risk:** The possibility of harm or data loss.
    

## Asset Management

- Maintain an inventory of all assets (hardware, software, cloud, SaaS).
    
- Regularly update asset inventory.
    
- Classify assets to prioritize protection.
    

## Assessment Standards

- **PCI DSS:** For credit card data protection.
    
- **HIPAA:** Protects patient data.
    
- **FISMA:** Federal information security.
    
- **ISO 27001:** Global information security standard.
    
- **Pentesting Standards:** PTES, OSSTMM, NIST, OWASP.

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

- Industry-standard for calculating vulnerability severity.
    
- Works with Microsoft DREAD (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected Users, Discoverability).
    

### Severity Scoring [link for calculator](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator)

- CVSS scoring factors:
    
    - **Base Metric Group:** Exploitability (Attack Vector, Complexity, Privileges) and Impact (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).
        
    - **Temporal Metric Group:** Exploit Code Maturity, Remediation Level, Report Confidence.
        
    - **Environmental Metric Group:** Adjusted for organization-specific risks.
        

### CVSS Calculation Example [hear](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527)

- Example: Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (Base Score: 8.8).
    
- Calculation considers all metric values (Base, Temporal, Environmental).

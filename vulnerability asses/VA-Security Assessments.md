## Overview

- **Security Assessments**: Tests to identify vulnerabilities in networks, computers, and applications.
    
- **Purpose**: Detect, confirm, and mitigate vulnerabilities.
    
- **Types**: Vulnerability Assessment, Penetration Test, Security Audit, Bug Bounty, Red Team Assessment, Purple Team Assessment.

## 1. Vulnerability Assessment

- **Definition**: A systematic evaluation of security weaknesses using a checklist or standard.
    
- **Key Points**:
    
    - Compliance-based (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS, OWASP).
        
    - Identifies known vulnerabilities without exploitation.
        
    - Suitable for all organizations.
        
    - Typically involves automated vulnerability scanners (e.g., Nessus).

## 2. Penetration Testing (Pentesting)

- **Definition**: Simulated cyberattack to test network defenses.
    
- **Types**:
    
    - **Black Box**: No prior knowledge of the system.
        
    - **Grey Box**: Limited knowledge, similar to an internal employee.
        
    - **White Box**: Full access to systems and configurations.
        
- **Pentester Types**:
    
    - Application Pentesters (Web, APIs, Mobile).
        
    - Network Pentesters (Infrastructure, Devices).
        
    - Physical Pentesters (Access control, Facilities).
        
    - Social Engineering Pentesters (Human-based attacks).
        
- **Security Maturity**: High maturity needed for effective pentesting.

## 3. Vulnerability Assessment vs. Pentesting

- **Vulnerability Assessment**:
    
    - Identifies known vulnerabilities (checklist).
        
    - Automated scans and manual validation (no exploitation).
        
- **Pentesting**:
    
    - Simulates real-world attacks.
        
    - Explores potential exploitation and attack paths.
        
    - Manual and automated methods.

## 4. Security Audits

- **Definition**: Compliance-focused assessments, usually mandated by external entities (e.g., PCI DSS).
    
- **Purpose**: Ensure adherence to security standards.
    

---

## 5. Bug Bounty Programs

- **Definition**: Public programs inviting external security researchers to find vulnerabilities.
    
- **Reward-Based**: Payouts for valid findings.
    
- **Ideal For**: Large companies (e.g., Microsoft, Apple) with strong security maturity.

## 6. Red Team Assessment

- **Definition**: Advanced, evasive black box testing simulating real-world attacks.
    
- **Objective**: Achieve a specific goal (e.g., accessing a critical server).
    
- **Red Team vs. Pentesting**: Red teams focus on stealth and achieving objectives, not just finding vulnerabilities.

## 7. Purple Team Assessment

- **Definition**: Collaboration between Red (Offensive) and Blue (Defensive) teams.
    
- **Purpose**: Strengthen defenses by combining offensive and defensive perspectives.

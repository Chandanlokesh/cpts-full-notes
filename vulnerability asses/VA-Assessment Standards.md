### Compliance Standards

- Organizations must comply with specific standards to ensure the credibility and acceptance of vulnerability assessments and penetration tests.
    
- Major compliance standards include:
    
    - **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**
        
        - Protects cardholder data for organizations handling credit card transactions.
            
        - Requires internal and external scanning of assets.
            
        - Key Goals: Secure network, protect data, maintain vulnerability management, strong access control, monitor networks, maintain security policy.
            
    - **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**
        
        - Protects patient data.
            
        - Requires risk assessments and vulnerability identification.
            
    - **FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act)**
        
        - Secures government operations and information.
            
        - Requires documentation of a vulnerability management program.
            
    - **ISO 27001 (International Organization for Standardization)**
        
        - Manages information security worldwide.
            
        - Requires quarterly external and internal scans.
            

### Penetration Testing Standards

- Pentesting should follow defined guidelines and have a legal contract outlining scope and responsibilities.
    
- Common pentesting standards include:
    
    - **PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)**
        
        - Covers: Pre-engagement, Intelligence Gathering, Threat Modeling, Vulnerability Analysis, Exploitation, Post Exploitation, Reporting.
            
    - **OSSTMM (Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual)**
        
        - Divided into channels: Human Security, Physical Security, Wireless Communications, Telecommunications, Data Networks.
            
    - **NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology)**
        
        - Phases: Planning, Discovery, Attack, Reporting.
            
    - **OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project)**
        
        - Focuses on web application security.
            
        - Guides include: Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG), Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG), Firmware Security Testing Methodology.

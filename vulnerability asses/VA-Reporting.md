## Vulnerabilities and Recommendations

- Remediation Steps
- Proof of Concept
- Affected Systems

The reporting portion of any assessment is the most crucial part of the project. Always make sure you are writing your reports such that any audience can read them. When discussing technical information, always reference what you describe for the reader to understand or reproduce what you are talking about in the report. Additionally, sentences should be to the point with proper grammar as well. The strongest reports are concise and clear for a reader.

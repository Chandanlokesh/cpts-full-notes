### scan policies
- allows to specify some option for the scan
- new policy -> basic network scan -> if we need we can customise -> create 
- Nessus works with plugins written in the [Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nessus_Attack_Scripting_Language)
- Plugins are rated by severity level: `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`, `Info`. At the time of this writing Tenable has published `145,973` plugins that cover `58,391` CVE IDs and `30,696` [Bugtraq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bugtraq) IDs. A searchable database of all published plugins is on the [Tenable website](https://www.tenable.com/plugins).

### **1. Managing Plugin Detections (False Positives):**

- **Plugins Tab:** Provides detailed information about each detected vulnerability, including mitigation steps.
    
- **False Positives:** Some detections may be considered false positives because they are intentional or safe by design (e.g., Microsoft DirectAccess using insecure cipher suites).
    
- **Creating Plugin Rules:**
    
    - Plugin rules can be set to exclude specific detections without disabling the plugin for other hosts.
        
    - You can specify a rule by providing:
        
        - Host (target IP/domain).
            
        - Plugin ID (unique ID for the detection).
            
        - Action (like "Hide this result").
            
        - Optional Expiration Date and Severity.
            

### **2. Credentialed Scanning:**

- **Credentialed Scanning:** Allows Nessus to use login credentials for deeper scans, accessing data that is not visible in unauthenticated scans.
    
- **Authentication Methods:**
    
    - **Linux:** SSH with password, public key, certificate, or Kerberos.
        
    - **Windows:** Password, LM/NTLM hashes, Kerberos.
        
    - **Databases:** Oracle, PostgreSQL, DB2, MySQL, SQL Server, MongoDB, and Sybase.
        
    - **Web Services:** HTTP, FTP, IMAP, Telnet, and more (using plaintext if needed).
        
- **Security Settings:** Options like "Never send credentials in the clear" ensure secure credential usage.
    
- **Success Verification:** Nessus can confirm successful credentialed logins in the scan report (e.g., "Nessus logged into MS SQL server").

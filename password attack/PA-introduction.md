- if we work with passwords and take a standard 8-digit password that consists only of upper case letters and numbers, we would get a total of `36‚Å∏` (`208,827,064,576`) possible passwords.

- can not able to find the actual password with the hash alone some of the techniques are    `rainbow table , dictionary attack, brute-forcing attacks`

### Rainbow tables

Rainbow tables are large pre-compiled maps of input and output values for a given hash function. These can be used to very quickly identify the password if its corresponding hash has already been mapped.

|Password|MD5 Hash|
|---|---|
|123456|e10adc3949ba59abbe56e057f20f883e|
|12345|827ccb0eea8a706c4c34a16891f84e7b|
|123456789|25f9e794323b453885f5181f1b624d0b|
- uses salting meaning adds extra bytes to the password called as salt

### brute force attack
A `brute-force` attack involves attempting every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until the correct password is discovered.

**Note:** Brute-forcing speeds depend heavily on the hashing algorithm and hardware that is used. On a typical company laptop, a tool like `hashcat` might be able to guess over `five million` passwords per second when attacking MD5, while at the same time only managing `ten thousand` per second when targeting a DCC2 hash.

### Dictionary attack
A `dictionary` attack, otherwise known as a `wordlist` attack, is one of the most `efficient` techniques for cracking passwords

known wordlists for password cracking are [rockyou.txt](https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt) and those included in [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists).
